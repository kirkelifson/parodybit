*last updated: 03/23/14*

A few months ago I initiated a plan to catalog the links that I find the most important; articles, essays, videos, and other various forms of 'must-see' information from around the web that I would even have my kids read. I consistently find myself referring back to the bookmarks I've created in the innocuous folder in Chrome dubbed 'essentials' since its inception. Because of this, I feel that I should make the contents of this folder public as I believe it may be very helpful to other people.

Take a look around. Look through links that appear important to you. I have special interests in space exploration, philosophy and software engineering. Chances are you won't find every single link as important to you as it is to me. However, I imagine there's at least one thing in here that may change your mind about a topic or simply make you feel better.

I'll keep this post constantly updated and may begin annotating some links. Check back every once in a while.

Add this page to your very own essentials folder.
