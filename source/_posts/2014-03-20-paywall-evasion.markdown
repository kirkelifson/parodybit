It's difficult these days not to encounter paywalls on news sites; a frequent irritant to me. An attempt to view a small article discdiscussing a  fascinating new scientific discovery introduces me to a slowly fading, scrolling, sliding, or exploding window frame telling me that I _must_ register on their site (or even donate money!) in order to view what exciting thing humans have created today. Nevermind the fact that I've primarily encountered paywalls on positive articles, while those that fuel hatred, bigotry, and intellectual malaise are left open. However, my opinion regarding the present state of the news media in America is for another post.

Getting to business, it's shockingly simple to bypass these blockades. Many times its easy enough to disable javascript on said domain. Both The New York Times and Foreign Policy have javascript-based paywalls in which the entire document is loaded before the paywall appears, meaning that it is trivial to access the information you would like to read.

That's all that's necessary. Paywalls that feature other techniques are not as easy to bypass (if possible at all).
