My favorite episode of Pendleton Ward's 'Adventure Time' is 'The Enchiridion!' (S01E05). Despite being a book "meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous," anyone can pick up the real-life version of the book online at Amazon for the large sum of $3. Literally 'The Manual,' it is a short collection of Stoic writings attributed to a Greek man named Epictetus from the 2nd century CE.

The book's appearance in the television show makes it appear orders of magnitude larger than Epictetus' writings (my copy is about 60 pages) yet the content holds equal value. Tiny excerpts of The Manual are misogynistic and downright strange, however, there is a remarkable ratio of useful content in such a short book. If you choose to read the Enchridion attempt to ignore such writing as it does not consume the whole book, nor any significant portion of it.

Take for example this great passage:

{% blockquote Epictetus, Enchridion (L.) %}
Whatever rules are proposed to you for the conduct of life abide by them, as if they were laws, as if you would be guilty of impiety if you transgressed any of them. And whatever any man shall say about you, do not attend to it: for this is no affair of yours. How long will you then still defer thinking yourself worthy of the best things, and in no matter transgressing the distinctive reason? Have you accepted the rules, which it was your duty to agree to, and have you agreed to them? What teacher then do you still expect that you defer to him the correction of yourself? You are no longer a youth, but already a full-grown man. If then you are negligent and slothful, and are continually making procrastination after procrastination, and intention after intention, and fixing day after day, after which you will attend to yourself, you will not know that you are not making improvement, but you will continue ignorant both while you live and till you die. Immediately then think it right to live as a full grown man, and one who is making proficiency, and let everything which appears to you to be the best be to you a law which must not be transgressed. And if anything laborious, or pleasant or glorious or inglorious be presented to you, remember that now is the contest, now are the Olympic Games, and they cannot be deferred; and that it depends on one defeat and one giving way that progress is either lost or maintained. Socrates in this way became perfect, in all things improving himself, attending to nothing except reason. But you, though you are not yet a Socrates, ought to live as one who wishes to be a Socrates.

This passage deals with one's ability to stand by her own principles, as well as one's realization that nothing is impossible and that dedication to such a realization is an incredibly important trait. 'Living as if' you are the hero you respect most in life is what Epictetus recommends to living a satisfactory life.

Of all the advice I have heard thus far, guidance similar to the selected passage contains the most deep and impactful I have encountered. Obtaining and realizing your ideals in life appear to me as an exceptionally rewarding path to embark upon. As Epictetus also states:

{% blockquote %}
First say to yourself what you would be;
and then do what you have to do.
{% endblockquote %}
