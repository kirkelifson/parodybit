Lately I've been feeling like Elon has been getting quite an overwhelming amount of press (basically since the stock took off in March/April '13) so I dug around a bit to look at other perspectives from within Tesla Motors.

Martin Eberhard, the ousted ex-CEO of Tesla is actually quite the inspirational character. I think he has done a great deal of good work in his previous ventures, as well as the inception of Tesla itself. I found a podcast lecture that he gave at Stanford back in 2007 (shortly before things became really negative towards his position in Tesla) about general advice he has for new entrepreneurs and lessons he learned from building Tesla's first car (the Roadster).

Here are the highlights:

1. Do something meaningful.

2. Be bold.

3. Think your ideas through.

4. Build your company while building your product.

5. Face reality (every day).

6. Hire the very best people.

7. Aggressively follow all leads.

Paired with the endless echoes of Elon's advice I believe this small list is a fantastic guide to follow.
