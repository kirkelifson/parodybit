Elon Musk, a 41 year-old Pretoria, South Africa native, helps push mankind forward through the 21st century day by day. Growing up reading countless science fiction novels later came full circle when he founded Space Explorations Technology Corporation, or known by many as SpaceX. Even this monumental private rocket business was envisioned after the founding and cofounding of companies such as Paypal, and Tesla Motors, both of which became (and are becoming) highly successful businesses.

It's incredible to think that a single person has had this much influence in the most important sectors of our daily lives at this point in history. Yet this man has done it all. As stated numerous times by Musk himself, he set out to focus on three main areas that he believes would greatly affect the future of mankind: the internet, alternative energy, and space exploration (making life multi-planetary).

I first heard about Musk in a [late-2010 interview from Wired](https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/09/ff_tesla/) featuring him on the front cover. Shortly thereafter I became highly interested in everything he did, believing that he would be one of the few people alive today to highly impact our future for the better. I was correct in my presumptions, especially after his successes in establishing contact between his own Dragon capsule and the International Space Station. On October 7th, 2012, I eagerly awaited the second launch of the Dragon capsule to the ISS at Kennedy Space Center, with an unobstructed viewing angle to what would become another successful mission for SpaceX. Not only did this confirm my re-attendance for the next launch slated for January or February of 2013, but it reignited my hopes and aspirations for the future of human space travel that had been sparked by my first-hand account of the final Space Shuttle launch, STS-135 in July of 2011.

Well, that's enough for an introduction, I probably got carried away. I'll let him do the rest of the talking. I compiled a short list of the best interviews conducted featuring him, as well as a few things that you, as an active participant in the future of humanity, should be aware of concerning what the future has in store for Elon.

A few promising things to look out for in the future from Elon Musk:

1. The Hyperloop. Elon's revolutionary idea that has the potential to change the future of transportation forever. Unfortunately there are not enough specifics about his plans that have been released, but in a couple of his most recent interviews he has stated that news will be coming out within the next few months.</p>
2. Tesla Model X.  The Tesla vehicle that has already been showcased at various events which is noted as "mid-price, mid-volume" by Musk. It's the 2nd stage in his three-stage process into introducing Tesla into the broader car market. It has the looks of a SUV and mini-van hybrid, but of course runs on pure electricity. The "falcon-wing" side-doors will also be a spectacle in which the doors open directly up and let people stand inside the car rather than awkwardly finagling to step into a mini-van with a standard sliding door.</p>
3. Mass-market Tesla vehicle. This is the vehicle planned to be released after the Model X debut that will surely put Tesla on the frontlines for most people looking to buy a new car. Estimated at about $30,000, this model will hopefully deliver the vehicle that everyone optimistic about the future of electric cars has been waiting for.</p>
4. SXSW 2013 Keynote appearance. Along with Matthew Inman of The Oatmeal, Elon will be delivering a keynote address to the Austin, Texas music and culture festival in early March. Anticipation of an announcement of plans for the Hyperloop is high.</p>

>Optimism, pessimism, fuck that; we're going to make it happen. As God is my bloody witness, I'm hell-bent on making it work.
