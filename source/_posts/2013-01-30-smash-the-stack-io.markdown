Throughout the next few weeks I plan to document my journey through Smash the Stack's set of IO challenges.
Smashthestack is an online wargame tailored to those willing to submit themselves to navigate their way through
a maze of tricky debugging and binary exploitation obstacles. The IO challenge set includes 30 unique parts
that are sure to get your mind working and in a specific mentality (albeit insane) to attack problems with a different perspective.

I had started IO years ago but gradually lost interest, but I have once again put myself up to the challenge.
I believe last time I reached level nine before backing down. However, this time I aim to complete all thirty challenges,
although I may require some help along the way.

Each level will be in a separate blog post as I make my way through the journey. However, it is _very_ important to note
that I suggest attempting the problems yourself before looking at the solution. This is my fair warning to those that
will encounter a large amount of spoilers in the coming blog posts. Also since it's a voluntary challenge, it's
generally accepted that you're doing this for your own benefit. Clearly there is no gain in 'cheating' by using these
walkthroughs of how I solved each level.

Anyways, I'll continue on to the next few levels in the coming days. Once I reach level 9 I will most likely
start slowing down.
