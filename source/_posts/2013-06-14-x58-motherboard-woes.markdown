Recently I ran into a problem after cleaning out my computer. After piecing it back together I attempted to boot, but my BIOS refused to POST. In the past I haven't had the best of luck reassembling my desktop; I tend to make a stupid mistake at some point and brick a hardware component, followed by an overwhelming deep regret of taking it apart in the first place. So my initial reaction came in the form of the mini-heart attack unique to losing expensive hardware. I sometimes believe that this could be fatal in the near future if it happens too often.

I quickly inspect everything to make sure I didn't miss a connection, and also google the codes I'm given on my motherboard. I didn't write them down so I do not recall the exact codes at this point, but I remember it being a vague error that could be caused by a multitude of issues (power supply failure, video cards, overheating, etc. etc.) I continue searching for a while but to no avail. I'm stumped because I refuse to believe my new graphics card is at fault, and there's nothing else I could have possibly missed while re-checking all of the connections.

About twenty minutes later I come across a post that mentions something about memory. Aha! Maybe one DIMM isn't clicked in yet. Well, no, that's not it because they're all snug. I think about it (embarassingly) for a bit longer and realize I had actually put in the DIMMs incorrectly. Eight years of computer building and repair and I put in memory wrong. Certainly it can't get much worse than that.

Fortunately for my fragile state of self-regard it wasn't completely wrong. Of course I put in the memory *correctly* otherwise the notch wouldn't even line up.

Note here: never forget that x58 motherboards require certain slots to be filled first in dual/triple channel configurations. Simple misalignment can cause much pain (to the chest and mind). So as I ponder why I took the time to make this into a story and not a simple quick fix, here's a simple tid-bit of handy information to remember: a majority of problems are miniscule. Don't become too sure of yourself, and always double check the obvious. It could potentially harm you more than an inconsequential hardware issue such as mine.
